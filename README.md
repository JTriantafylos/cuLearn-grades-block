# cuLearn-grades-block
Add a custom block to your cuLearn dashboard containing all your grades from all classes in one place. Written using JS and jQuery

# How does it work?
Essentially this customization adds js code into a block on your cuLearn dashboard to add more advanced functionality.
The code makes requests to each of the grades pages for your classes for the current/most recent semester available.

# How to use
1) Open your cuLearn dashboard and click the "Customize this Page" button in the top right corner
2) Scroll down to the "add a block" dropdown menu, and add a new HTML block
3) Go to your new block and click the gear icon then click "configure this block"
4) You can title the block however you want, I reccomend "Grades Table"
5) In the content box click the button on the left side of the toolbar to show more buttons
6) Click the button that looks like < > html tags to edit your block as HTML.
7) Paste the contents of the block.html file in this repository.
8) Save the changes to your block and profit off saving a couple clicks to see if your TA's have pushed out grades yet!
